# Overview of the Biodiversity Analysis 

I analyze two datasets which contain information gathered by the National Parks Service for four major National Parks in the United States.  Throughout the analysis, I attempt to find any relationships within the data that can aid in the prevention of species becoming endangered and/or help in the reversal of a species endangerment status.  All findings from the analysis are summarized and presented in a PowerPoint document.

Documents in the Repository:

- 'Biodiversity_Scope.txt' - A procedure for how to work through the data during the analysis (prefer a more specific question-based method but I tried something different for this analysis).
- 'Biodiversity_Analysis.ipynb' - Jupyter Notebook file where the analysis takes place.  I perform the analysis using Python and I also keep note of findings and progress throughout the analysis using text markdown.
- 'National Park Biodiversity Data Analysis.pptx' - PowerPoint presentation that covers significant graphs and findings through an analysis summary.
- 'Biodiversity_Analysis_pp_pdf.pdf' - PDF of the PowerPoint presentation for easier accessability and readability.
- 'observations.csv' - Dataset from the 'National Parks Service' that contains information on four United States National Parks.  This information includes the park names, the scientific names of the species within the park, and the number of observations for each species in a 7 day period in a given park.
- 'species_info.csv' - Dataset from the 'National Parks Service' that contains information on different species found in United States National Parks.  This information includes the scientific names and common names for species, the categories that different species fall under, and the conservation status of each species.
