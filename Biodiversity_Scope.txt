Biodiversity Analysis

Step 0: Understand the Problem
- More closely understand which species have higher chances of becoming endangered.
- We need to understand this so we can then find ways to help a specific species moving forward.

Step 1: Define the Goal(s)
- Find patterns in endangered species that can help pervent other species from becoming endangered as well.

Step 2: What actions/interventions are you informing?
- Depending on the patterns found within the analysis, necessary action can be taken to aid in the prevention of other species becoming endangered.
- These actions could be addressed to the general population, corporations, or anyone directly related to the findings of the analysis.

Step 3: What data do you have and what data do you need?
- We have two datasets.
- One dataset contains information pertaining to different species (scientific_name, category, conservation_status, etc.).
- The other dataset contains information about different parks, which species live in these parks, and how many times these species have been spotted in the last 7 days. 

Step 4: What analysis needs to be done?
- Many types of analysis will need to be done to find what we are looking for.
- We need detection to find all the currently endangered species.
- We can then use descriptive techniques to uncover patterns amongst the endangered species.
- We can also analyze non-endangered species to see if they possess any of the same patterns that the endangered species possess.
- Finally, we can predict if a non-endangered species may possibly become endangered in the future based off of our current findings.

Questions used to navigate the analysis:
1. How many observations of ‘Not at Risk’ species are there in each park?
2. What is the total number of observations in each park? 
3. What percent do the observations of each conservation status make up within each park?
4. Do ‘Endangered’ species have less observations on average?
5. What can we learn about categories by looking into the number of species in each conservation status?
6. What happens when we exclude the ‘Not At Risk’ species while analyzing categories and conservation statuses?
7. What percent do the observations of each category make up within each park? 
8. What is the most endangered category of species and is this finding statistically significant?
