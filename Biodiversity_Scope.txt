Biodiversity Analysis

Step 0: Understand the Problem
- More closely understand which species have higher chances of becoming endangered.
- We need to understand this so we can then find ways to help a specific species moving forward.

Step 1: Define the Goal(s)
- Find patterns in endangered species that can help pervent other species from becoming endangered as well.

Step 2: What actions/interventions are you informing?
- Depending on the patterns found within the analysis, necessary action can be taken to aid in the prevention of other species becoming endangered.
- These actions could be addressed to the general population, corporations, or anyone directly related to the findings of the analysis.

Step 3: What data do you have and what data do you need?
- We have two datasets.
- One dataset contains information pertaining to different species (scientific_name, category, conservation_status, etc.).
- The other dataset contains information about different parks, which species live in these parks, and how many times these species have been spotted in the last 7 days. 

Step 4: What analysis needs to be done?
- Many types of analysis will need to be done to find what we are looking for.
- We need detection to find all the currently endangered species.
- We can then use descriptive techniques to uncover patterns amongst the endangered species.
- We can also analyze non-endangered species to see if they possess any of the same patterns that the endangered species possess.
- Finally, we can predict if a non-endangered species may possibly become endangered in the future based off of our current findings.
